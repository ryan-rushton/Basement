Basement
------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is it?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Basement is a webapp built in flask to allow for the easy addition of webscrapers to a database and search framework.
Currently only a pastebin scraper has been built.

Basement used both PostgreSQL and Elasticsearch as databases. Elasticsearch for efficient searching of data stored
and Postgresql as a backup in the event that Elasticsearch may want to be reindexed.

Web requests can also be forced to run through Tor.

In this form it is designed to be run on Macintosh OSX but little modification needs to be done to make it run on
Ubunutu.

Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please see the requirements.txt file for python packages required.
Elasticsearch, Tor and PostgreSQL are also required.

How to run?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
First install a virtual environment using python 3, I used one called virtual_env.
Then install the libraries outlined in requirements.txt.
Ensure postgresql is installed and a table exists called basement. On OSX I used the PostgreSQL app. Config for
postgres is in the config.py file.
Run the db_create.py script.
Make sure elasticsearch is installed and the path to the executable is included in app/__init__.py file. I used the
homebrew install for OSX.
Finally using the virtual environment envoke the run.py file.
